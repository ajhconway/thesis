TODO:


- In the proof of Lemma 4.4, the step from (6) to (7). I fail to see why this
  is an inequality rather than an equality. After all, \sum_j f_j E[Z(\chi^A)
  \mid \phi_j] = E[Z]. For the last term in (6), you say that R^A_j should be
  the random variable of how many balls are recycled given the jth bin is
  chosen by A. This doesn't really make sense to me, since then in the
  calculation we would compare an expectation with a random variable, so I
  assume you mean the conditional expectation instead of the random variable.
  (As it was in Lemma 4.2.) But then \sum_j f_j R^A_j = R^A, so we should have
  equality.

So I think that Equation (9) should be an equality, and the inequality only
comes in the next step (10). 

- Lemma 4.2: In the text, R^A should be R^A_L.
- Lemma 4.5: One of the p is typeset in non-bold, same in Lemma 4.6.
- Lemma 4.6: Does the term "stateless" includes "deterministic"? Otherwise your
  notation needs some explanation.
- Corollary 5.1: The second = should be \leq as well.

Writing is the weakest part of the paper. It seems that paper has suffered a
lot by moving very relevant things to the appendix. 
In particular, Appendix A
is almost a must-read. 
Many of the basic concepts or notations have not been
clearly defined (stateless at page 7, the notion of (AX)_j), and there is also
very confusing referencing back and forth which requires constant flips back
and forth. Furthermore, some of the statements seems inconsistent. Proof of
Lemma 4.1 is referred to the appendix but in the appendix there is no clear
proof and it feels like a mess! Lemma A.2 certainly needs more than just one
line for its proof and notion of “ergodic” is thrown in there without ever
being defined!

- Section 2. When you mention the work of Vöcking, you forgot to refer to the
  paper [41].
